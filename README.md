*Some notes about this project:

    Due to short duration deadline, unfortunately, this project is not 100% completed, there are still many things to improve.

    We haven't fully integrated the video interface to the rest of the project, so make sure it is run on http://localhost:8081 for the code to run correctly
    

*Peerjs notice:
    There are a few issues with this library, including duplicated data on data received event
    
    To make the signalling server run properly, make sure to install it on your local machine
